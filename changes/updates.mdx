  <h2>Open Alpha Release</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to the Whispbot open alpha. During this time, you may use Whisp, but
    you may encounter bugs while using it. We try to make our features ready for
    release before pushing them to the production model, but that doesn't stop
    issues from slipping through. If you encounter a bug, please report it to
    one of our staff members as soon as possible in our [Discord
    server](https://whisp.bot/support).
  </p>
